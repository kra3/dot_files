# ViM

"NeoVim + SpaceViM" is a good alternative if you want to experiment. 
They use all those japanese plugin echo systems, which I find hard to get any
documentations if at all. So, I've my own little vim configurations with stuff
which I am able to decipher/understand. 

> Assuming ViM 8, will try to be backward compatible. Also, I use terminal vim

# Set-up

Uses vim-plug now, for context aware/dynamic loading and stuff like that.
Follow install instructions from https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
For linux, it is like below (* at the moment)

> curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

After vim-plug is setup & git configurations are in home directory, open vim 
and run :PlugInstall to set-up all the plugins.

There are a couple of plugins which needs additional softwares to be installed.
