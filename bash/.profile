# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
#
# Hence, (1) create .bash_profile. (2) link .bash_profile as .profile, if you don't care about other shells

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022
